# Used-Car-Price-Analysis
Context: Developed a comprehensive predictive analysis project using a dataset of used cars to understand the factors influencing pricing. The goal was to provide insights into the used car market and create a predictive model to assist buyers and sellers.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn
* Conducted EDA to visualize key attributes, including price distributions, mileage, and year of manufacture, utilizing histograms and scatter plots to identify trends.
* Analyzed correlations between variables, particularly focusing on the relationship between car price, mileage, and year.
* Built a multiple linear regression model to predict car prices based on various factors, achieving a significant understanding of how features like year and mileage impact pricing.
* Performed hypothesis testing to compare car prices across different states and geographical zones.
* Created visual representations of data distributions and relationships, including PMFs and CDFs, to communicate insights effectively.
* Summarized findings in a final report, offering actionable insights for stakeholders in the automotive market.
